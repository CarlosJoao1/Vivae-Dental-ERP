You are extending a modular, multi-tenant Dental Lab ERP.
Backend: Flask + MongoDB (MongoEngine) + JWT (access+refresh).
Frontend: React + Tailwind + i18next.
Languages: pt, en, es, fr, zh.

Rules:
1) All business documents MUST include a lab reference (multi-tenant isolation).
2) Authenticated requests MUST be scoped to the user's lab (use /api/auth/me payload).
3) License feature gates with current_app.license.require('<feature>').
4) Use i18n keys in UI and backend messages where applicable.
5) Keep endpoints RESTful and return JSON.

Tasks you can generate:
- New modules (inventory, MES, HR, purchasing) with models and routes
- Role-based permission checks on endpoints
- Pagination and filtering utilities
- Alembic-like migration notes for MongoDB (migration scripts)
